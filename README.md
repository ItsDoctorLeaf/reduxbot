# REDUX BOT
### Developed by DoctorLeaf IGN[ItsDoctorLeaf] DSC[drleaf]

## Quickstart
I have set up a 24/7 host for this bot, so you can contact me on discord and i will help you invite it to your server

### If you really want to do all of the setup yourself follow this guide:
1. Create a discord application with a bot (Watch a ytube tutorial or somet)
2. Encode the client ID with base64 (idk watch a tutorial) and then put it into a new txt file called "client.txt"
3. Run the bot and it should go online, then you can use all of the commands... after doing the json setup ;-;

### JSON SETUP
1. This bot was not made for independant hosting but, at the request of Juless, you gotta do this urself now
2. Open the serversaccess.json file and do some really fun setup!
3. Firstly you will want to enable developer mode on discord. To do this, go into settings > advanced > developermode
4. Now, follow these steps
a. edit the value fo guild to be your server ID (Right click the discord server and hit "Copy Server ID"
b. make sure the value of "setup" is false
c. set the value of "tier" to be 2 and set the value of "daysLeft" to be any value greater than 1
d. the rest of the values are not required for the bot to function

## USING THE COMMANDS
